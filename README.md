February
===================

So I apologize if this is terrible I'm having a time trying to figure this out. For my passage in Barnes I chose February when she is talking about Saints Days. What interested me was how she adapted this type of writing to make it something relevant to her book. The question I want to pose is what was Saints Days originally and why was it important. 

----------


Internal Evidence 
-------------

In the text we have noticed that the author keeps throwing hints at us that she is mocking old religious values and the fact that she put a Saints Days column in the text is another indication of this. In the month of February she breaking old traditions by making her sentiments known and saying that only god would know what to do if she received the affections of this other woman. 




----------


External Evidence 
-------------------

I used my external source from Harner titled **A Handbook of Dates for Students of British History**, to see some examples from Saints Days. It is used to correspond each day of the year to a particular Saint. This makes sense as to why Barnes would use this example to talk about the things that Dame Musset had done that caused her to become a Saint. 




What it might Mean 
-------------
From this internal and external evidence we can conclude that Barnes has used this form of literature to accurately compare Dame Musset to a Saint. Also that she may be poking fun at the traditional views of the church. 



Day 2
-------------
For Day 2 I chose to adress the question "Is there any indications for a real saint (such as Saint Musset) that stands for homosexuality?" By consulting the source I chose titled **Manual of the Writings in Middle English (M1825)
Severs, J. Burke, Albert E. Hartung, and Peter G. Beidler, gen. eds. A Manual of the Writings in Middle English, 1050–1500. 12 vols. New Haven: Connecticut Acad. of Arts and Sciences, 1967– . PR255.M3 016.820′9′001. Vol. 2: Pearl Poet; Wyclyf and His Followers; Translations and Paraphrases of the Bible, and Commentaries; Saints’ Legends; Instructions for Religious. 1970.** I found the answer to be no. While there were a couple promiscuous Saints, there were none that were the patron for homosexuality. 

Another question I chose to adress was "How are other saints appointed (if that is the correct term) to that title compared to the actions of Musset?" For this I found an interesting video that explains it well.
